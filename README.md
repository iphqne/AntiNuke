# AntiNuke
AntiNuke for Discord Servers using the Anarchy (https://github.com/not-ilinked/Anarchy) API wrapper<br>
(initially) Made in around 1 hour and 40 minutes (longer if you count updates)<br>
Thank you 6K (https://github.com/6K6666) for helping me test this<br>
<br>
Speed test (this test was made using the default settings (2 channels))<br>
Only 2 channels (1 category) was deleted before the bot banned the raider<br>
